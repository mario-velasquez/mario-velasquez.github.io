					<p>University of Texas Rio Grande Valley <br> Bachelore of Science & Engineering in Computer
						Engineering <br> Software Concentration <br> Expected Graduation May 2021 <br> Current GPA: 3.31
					</p>
					<p>Computer Engineering is essentially a combination of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,
						There are three concentrations one could take on. Hardware, General and Software. Being a
						software concentration means I have taking more Software classes from the Computer Science
						Department rather than Electrical Engineering Courses. </p>
					<p><b> Key Courses</b>
						<br><a href="https://www.coursicle.com/utrgv/courses/CSCI/4333/" target=”_blank”>Database Design
							& Implement</a>
						Study of logical (hierarchical, network, relational) and physical (sequential, indexed,
						relative) organization of databases. Database management systems and their features, querying
						databases, distributed databases, and data compression.
						<br><a href="https://www.coursicle.com/utrgv/courses/CSCI/3333/" target=”_blank”>Algorithims and
							Data Structures</a> This course is a continuation of data structures topics covered in CSCI
						2380. Content includes theoretical topics in algorithmic efficiency and complexity, along with
						abstract data types, including graphs, networks, trees, and priority queues. Search topics,
						including hashing, trees, external search trees (B-trees), and sorting algorithms including
						external sorting are introduced and compared. Computational complexity topics include the class
						P and NP, NP-completeness and reducibility, NP-completeness proofs, and NP-complete problems.
						<br><a href="https://www.coursicle.com/utrgv/courses/CSCI/4345/" target=”_blank”>Computer
							Networks</a>
						An introduction to data communication topics, including data transmission, encoding, data link
						control, switching, network topologies, protocols, internet working and data security. Examples
						of existing networks and network architectures are studied
						<br><a href="https://www.coursicle.com/utrgv/courses/CSCI/3340/" target=”_blank”>Software
							Engineering I</a>
						A formal approach to the state-of-the-art techniques in software design and development.
						Emphasis will be on Project Planning, Requirements, Specification, and System Design and
						includes object design, testing, and implementation. Provides the student with the opportunity
						to work on large projects in a group situation
						<br><a href="https://www.coursicle.com/utrgv/courses/CSCI/3341/" target=”_blank”>Software
							Engineering II</a>
						The course will cover the analysis of requirements and software architecture with a major
						emphasis on object design, implementation, testing and validation, maintenance and software
						re-engineering. Methods for evaluating software for correctness, and reliability, system testing
						techniques, testing tools and limitations of testing, Advance Software Engineering topics such
						as Design Patterns, Aspect Oriented Engineering, Interactive Design Methods, and Formal
						Specification are included. Students will work a large group projects.
